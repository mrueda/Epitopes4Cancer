# Epitopes4Cancer

Project developed at [SRTI](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/) in collaboration with [Ali Torkamani](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/torkamani/), [Brunhilde Felding](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/felding-habermanni) and [Vaughn Smider](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/smider/) during 2015.

The objective was finding potential epitopes (in public repositories for cancer) for antibody-based cancer treatment.

We used COSMIC database and ranked its variants according to several parameters, such as if a given mutation was in a Cysteine-rich regioni, or their distance from a transmembrane region.
